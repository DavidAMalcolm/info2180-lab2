					<h2>Young Sprouts Shall Not be Watered</h2>
					<p class="blogInfo">September 26,2023 by David Malcolm</p>
					<img src="computerGrass.jpg" alt="Young developers being nurtured" class="grassImg">	
					<p>  As many young developers no doubt have realized after starting their journey in the field of computer science the difficulty of getting an internship or part-time job is a herculean endeavour requiring hours and day of blood, sweat and tears applying and being denied by countless postions. Only to finally reach the beginning stages of an interview and hear the key word of many employers that have no doubt haunted many and left them feeling unjustifiably lacking, yes the words "not enough experience" echoes by hiring managers across all lands. The job landscape no longer allows for individuals to be built up from companies any more, no instead young developers should magically be able to climb out of college or coding camps with 3 years working experience in languages and frameworks that have been out for at most 4 years. Gone are the days of our parents where employees could learn on the job no degrees required and be afforded a stable living all while developing themsevles in their careers.</p> 
					
					<p>The younger genereation shall not expect to be nurtured for by employers but instead grind away at unpaid internships in hopes of landing a post at a company that might let them go to shore up some money for dividends after years of hard development work. It is no wonder that those young sprouts have instead opted to form their own companies amongst themselves dealing with development work on a more contract term basis instead of the traditional salaried work. Trying their best to survive without the care given to previous generations as we sadly have let these sprouts to wilt away they try their best to eke out a lviing in the wild on their own terms. I hope that more of such scenarios happen and we young developers can bear the drought.</p>

					<h2>AI and Employment: Are We Doing More Harm Than Good?"</h2>

					<p>As I'm sure like I many of you have probably heard of the recent innovations made in artificial intelligence. The premier application at the forefront of all of this is of course ChatGPT, a chatbot with the ability to answer and write back to questions given to it in a very detailed manner. Its incredibly detailed in some of its answers allowing it to in some cases to write entire children's books, cover letters and one of major concern to some of my viewers would be the propensity for it to allow for students to cheat on their essays. However, the focus today will be on something a bit more important, it is the ability for these innovative AI technologies to replace jobs, as even  in this technologies infancy it has been speculated that it could replace over 300 million full-time jobs in the near future.</p>
					<p>As we make life easier and more efficient through these innovations we have to ask ourselves at the end what should human beings do to adjust to this decrease in need to work in our capitalistic society, as the wy things stand now this would surely be fatal and as the ones typically responsible for these innovations we have to ask ourselves if these advancements in technology are doing more harm than good to the ones we made it for.</p>
